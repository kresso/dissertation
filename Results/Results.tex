\section{Signal determination}
The signal efficiency of the selection is evaluated as the ratio between the number of selected events in each of the six channels (electron and muon channels, 0-, 1-, and 2-btag categories) under study and the total number of generated events in the Monte Carlo samples.  The signal efficiency as a function of the Higgs mass is fitted to a polynomial in order to be estimated for those Higgs mass hypothesis where no Monte Carlo sample is available, 
%as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lineshape}.
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:effvsmass}.

The narrow width approximation breaks down at high Higgs mass (typically $>400 GeV$) due to the very large Higgs width ($>70 GeV$). 
A more correct approach to describe the Higgs invariant-mass distribution has been proposed, known as Complex Pole Scheme (CPS)~\cite{Goria:2011wa}.
The total Higgs production cross section has been recomputed by the Higgs Cross Section Working Group to include the corrections due to CPS at high Higgs mass~\cite{LHC-HCS}.  In this analysis the simulated signal samples are properly re-weighted to follow the CPS.

At high Higgs mass the interference between the Higgs signal and the $gg\rightarrow ZZ$ background becomes large~\cite{Passarino:2012ri}.  The effect of interference has been shown to be constructive below the Higgs mass peak and destructive above. It therefore has a negligible effect on the total cross section (1-2\%) but it biases the ZZ invariant-mass distribution. Moreover the interference has been computed only at LO (leading order) while the signal is known at NNLO (next to next to leading order). In this analysis the uncertainty due to missing higher perturbative order on the interference and the simulated line-hape is also corrected in the re-weighting~\cite{Passarino:2012ri}.

After this is done, the obtained distribution should reflect the expectation for the Higgs events, both in yield and shape. This re-weighting has been included in the analysis in order to account for the correct distributions.

\section{Results}

Since the decay products of the Higgs boson can be fully reconstructed, it is possible to use the reconstructed Higgs boson mass distribution to discriminate Higgs signal events against background events. The reconstructed mass will peak around the true Higgs boson mass, $m_{H}$, for the signal, while for background processes it will have a broader distribution.  Consequently, a shape-based treatment of the expected and observed distribution of the invariant mass of the Higgs candidate (i.e. the 4-object mass) increases the sensitivity of the analysis, compared to a simpler counting experiment. Since the expected shape of the background and the signal cannot be obtained from first principles, an analytic function cannot be used. Therefore, a binned histogram-based calculation has been used for the shape analysis.

The normalization of the simulated background (Z+jets and diboson) in the signal region is allowed to vary.  The constraints come from the number of events in the $m_{jj}$ sideband in data. The signal-free regions of the $\mlljj$ distribution impose an additional constraint to the background normalization. The observed and expected numbers of events in the sideband region are given as input to the limit calculation tool. The calculation to discriminate signal from background events is performed independently for the six individual analysis channels (electrons and muons in the 0, 1, and 2-btag categories), and then combined taking into account the correlations among the systematic uncertainties. These uncertainties may affect either the shape of the distributions or their normalization, and are properly taken into account in the statistical analysis.

The mass distributions of the $\LL jj$ system are depicted in Figures~\ref{fig:ichepllqq} and~\ref{fig:ichepllqqLOG} for data in the signal region. The statistical uncertainty on the background is much smaller than the statistical uncertainty on the data, as the number of Z+jets simulated events used to estimate this background corresponds to a luminosity from 5 to 10 times larger. The full dataset (19.6~\fbinv{}) is used to assess the good modeling of the background in the $m_{jj}$ sideband region (Figures~\ref{fig:llqqSB} and~\ref{fig:llqqSBLOG}). Residual differences are taken as a systematic uncertainty, as explained in the previous section. As a cross check, the $\mlljj$ distributions for the electron and muon channels are studied separately, both in the $m_{jj}$ sideband and signal regions.  They show an excellent agreement as can be seen in Appendix~\ref{sec:emuratios}.

Expected upper limits on the SM Higgs boson production cross section are determined as function of the Higgs boson mass hypothesis, taking as input the $\mlljj$ distribution for data, and for the background and signal expectations. The statistical procedure, based on the profile likelihood method, uses the \textit{asymptotic CL$_s$}~\cite{AsymptCLs} approach, implemented in the official tool developed by the CMS Higgs combination group~\cite{HiggsLimitTWiki}. Systematic uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters.

The results are expressed as upper limits on the ratio of the cross section times branching fraction of the process $\Htollqq\ $, divided by the expectation for the standard model Higgs boson, $\sigma / \sigma_\mathrm{SM}$. A particular Higgs boson mass hypothesis is excluded whenever \mbox{$\sigma / \sigma_\mathrm{SM} < 1$}. The observed limit on $\sigma / \sigma_\mathrm{SM}$ is determined for $\MH$ hypotheses between 230~GeV and 650~GeV, using $\mlljj$ distributions defined in the range from 220~GeV to 800~GeV. The $\mlljj$ region below 220~GeV presents a very sharp rising edge from Z+jets which is difficult to have under control and is excluded from the analysis.

Figure~\ref{fig:limit5fb} shows the expected and observed limits for the full dataset recorded during 2012 at 8~\TeV{}, corresponding to a luminosity of 19.6~\fbinv{}. With the increased luminosity in this dataset the 2-btag category becomes the most powerful contribution to the combination of the six channels (Figure~\ref{fig:limit20fb_split}). These results were cross-checked with an independent statistical method (Appendix~\ref{sec:cutcount}).
%Other CMS searches have produced limits with on a much finer grid of resonance mass hypothesis. In order to combine our results with these searches, we interpolate the histograms used as for the signal hypothesis to those points where no simulation is available. For this interpolation we use the Radial-Basis-Function (RBF) method~\cite{numrec}.

Limits on the SM production cross section times branching fraction for $\HZZ$ are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:limitxs}. For comparison, expectations are shown for a SM-like Higgs boson. In addition, the limits as observed in this study are combined with the results of the previous analysis on the 2011 data sets~\cite{HIG-11-027}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:combination}.
