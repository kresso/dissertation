% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

%\begin{frame}{Introduction}
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item
%    This looks at extending the $Z_{jj}$ window cuts from 75 to 105 GeV to 70 to 110 GeV.
%  \item
%    Using the latest skims with the Higgs mass reweighting.
%  \item
%    The final region (using helyldrefit and met cuts)
%  \end{itemize}
%\end{frame}


%\begin{frame}{Pecent of Events in $Z_{jj}$ mass windows}
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item
%    The Next three slides show the percent of events in our final selection of various $Z_{jj}$ windows compared to no $Z_{jj}$ cut. 
%  \item
%    The thing to look for is how much signal and background is in the extra region (70-75 and 105-110) as well as if it is worth extending the side band (55-60 and 130-135).

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{center}
    This presentation is to go over my contribution to the characterization and test results of the 3D silicon CMS Pixel detectors at Purdue University.

\begin{frame}{Software}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Set up local server to store pixel information.
    \item
      To avoid data loss that had happened with previous tests I created a redundant backup system both local and on the Purdue network.
    \item
      Created a MySQL database on the server that was interfaced through a custom written GUI for the storage of the data.
    \item
      All calculations and plotting automatically done with C++, root, and perl.
     \end{itemize}
 \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Before/After Wire-Bonding}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      All of the measurements that I personally did were after wire-bonding.
     \end{itemize}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/IV_ba.pdf}

  \small    Comparing with the previous measurements done by measuring on the wafer we were able to see that there was an improvement across all the modules after wire-bonding. This is because when the sensors were tested on the wafers only a temporary metal layer was used to connect the columns led to extra leakage current.


 \end{center}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{I-V Measurement}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      On the ROC measured each pixel response for a set bias voltage.
    \item
      For each pixel I fit the IV curve to an S-curve (step function convoluted with a Gaussian).
    \item
      From the slope of the S curve at efficiency of 0.5 we calculate the equivalent noise charge (ENC).
      \begin{equation} ENC = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\dfrac{1}{s} \end{equation}
     \end{itemize}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/efficiency.pdf}

  \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Noise}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      After finding the ENC for each pixel the distribution is fit with a Gaussian.
    \item
      (1 VCAL = 65.5 electrons)
    \end{itemize}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/map.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/noise.pdf}

  \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bias Voltage}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Additionally you can calculate these values for varying bias voltages.
    \item
      We found that up till 40 V there is significant improvement but afterward the improvement levels off.
    \end{itemize}
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{images/bias.pdf}
%\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/noise.pdf}

  \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Threshold}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      The threshold is the voltage where efficiency equals 0.5 on the IV curve.
    \item
      This was measured both with and without trimming.
    \end{itemize}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/threshold1.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/threshold2.pdf}

  \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      The conclusion from my measurements with others in the group was that the signal to threshold (S/T) ratio for these detectors is around 3 while for the Super LHC you need a S/T ratio of around 4 in midlife and around 3 at the end of life.
    \end{itemize}
