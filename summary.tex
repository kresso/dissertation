\section{Summary}

There are many improvements that can be made to the analysis for the 2012 data to both improve sensitivity and extend the analysis range. There is also more work that needs to be done to with the new data that is constantly arriving from the CMS detector.


\subsection{Future Plans}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Train analysis for high mass range (from 600 GeV to 1000 GeV).
\item
  Run limit calculations on the MVA analysis.
\item
  Run tag and probe efficiency calculations for muons.
\item
  Optimize $Z_{ll}$ and $Z_{jj}$ cuts for preselection.
\item
  Improve reconstruction of high mass jets.
\item
  Run analysis over full 2012 data sample at the end of the run.
\end{itemize}
