\label{sec:systematics}


In this chapter the systematic uncertainties affecting the analysis, the methods used to estimate them, and their calculated values are described. The following signal uncertainties include: Lepton Trigger and Selection, Jet Reconstruction, b-tagging, MET, pile-up, production mechanism, luminosity, and Higgs cross-section.  After the treatment on signal uncertainties the background uncertainties are given as well.

\subsection{Trigger and Lepton Selection Efficiency}

To calculate the lepton efficiency we use the tag and probe method. This method is a way to use a data sample of pure leptons from Z boson decays to find efficiencies.  We require our events to contain a minimum of two leptons from a Z decay as well as a minimum of one jet.  This matches the event topology that we use in the analysis. The requirements for tag and probe events are shown in Table~\ref{tab:tagandprobe_requirements}. After measuring efficiency in data by applying the same method to measure simulation efficiency, we are able to calculate the scale factors for data to simulation. The complete efficiency measurement can be split into five relative measurements: tracking efficiency, reconstruction efficiency, identification efficiency, isolation efficiency , and the total trigger efficiency.  This is expressed in equation (\ref{eq:efficiency_eq}).
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{lepton} = \epsilon_{tracking} \times \epsilon_{RECO/tracking} \times \epsilon_{ID/RECO} \times \epsilon_{ISO/ID} \times \epsilon_{trigger/ISO}
\label{eq:efficiency_eq}
\end{equation}
Each term in the total efficiency is calculated separately and is found using the official tag-and-probe method. This is a well established efficiency extraction technique. The efficiencies are measured in $p_T$ and $\eta$ bins. The trigger used for the 2012 data is the HLT\_Ele17\_CaloIdVT\_CaloIsoVT\_TrkIdT\_TrkIsoVT\_Ele8\_SC8\_Mass50. The trigger needs to be selected to yield unbiased efficiencies for each type. Also the cuts for the L1 and HLT triggers must be looser than those being measured. The tag is required to pass the WP Medium which is given in Appendix~\ref{sec:datamcsf}. Also the tag is spatially matched to a triggering object and has an energy above 32 GeV. For the tag-probe pair it is required that there is opposite charge for the tag and probe and that the event is within the window of 60 - 120 GeV. When there are multiple tag-probe pairs all of the pairs are used in order to avoid biasing the measurement. $\epsilon_{tracking}$ is assumed to be essentially 100\% \cite{WandZCrossSections}.

For $\epsilon_{RECO}$ the probes are super clusters with the standard $\eta$ cuts and an energy above 10 GeV. At least one jet has to have a $p_T$ $>$ 5 GeV and the Hadronic energy fraction must be greater than 0.15. If there are photons in the events the requirements are hadronicOverEm $<$ 0.15, standard $\eta$ cuts, for the barrel sigmaIetaIeta $<$ 0.01 while for end cap sigmaIetaIeta $<$ 0.03, and superCluster.energy * sin( superCluster.position.theta ) $>$ 20 GeV. For the electrons, passing probes are those that are reconstructed with the GSF algorithm giving a GSF electron.  When calculating these efficiencies a fit is used as seen in Figure ~\ref{fig:2012data_outputSCToGsfElectron}.  The fit range is 60 -120 GeV. The functional form of the signal PDF is formed from a Breit-Wigner convoluted with a ``crystal ball'' function. The background PDF is an exponential multiplied by an error function modeling the kinematic turn on of CMS. The values are reported in Appendix~\ref{sec:hltsf}.
%~\ref{tab:tagandprobe_reco}.


$\epsilon_{ISO}$ is computed with the same fits as described for calculating $\epsilon_{RECO}$, as well as the same tags. The fits can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:2012data_outputGsfElectronToId}. This time the probes are required to be GSF Electrons and the passing probes are those GSF Electrons that also pass WP Medium (as described in Appendix~\ref{sec:datamcsf}). For electrons, the electron identification efficiency is factorized together with isolation and the efficiencies are shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:hltsf}.


Counting passing vs failing probes is used instead of fitting because the backgrounds are predicted from Monte Carlo to be negligible. The tags are again the same as described before. The probes are those GSF Electrons that pass WP medium and the passing probes pass one the the legs of the HLT for the DoubleElectron dataset. For those electrons passing the HLT we calculate the efficiency in two parts.  The ``legs'' and the corresponding filters are given in Table~\ref{tab:trigger_stuff}. These efficiencies are shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:hltsf}.

 For muons the total normalization uncertainty is 2.7\%, with contributions from the trigger (2.5\%), identification (1.0\%), and isolation (0.4\%). For electrons the total normalization uncertainty is 2\%, dominated by identification (2\%) and a much smaller contribution from the dielectron trigger efficiency. Normalization uncertainties related to the electron energy scale and the muon momentum scale are very small; always much below than 1\%.

\subsection{Jet Reconstruction}
\label{JESsystematics}

There are two components of the uncertainty on jets.  One is the jet energy scale (JES) and the other is the resolution.  The resolution uncertainty is negligible compared to other uncertainties but the JES does make a measurable effect.  The uncertainty on the JES is computed by shifting the $p_T$ of the jets $\pm 1 \sigma$ with respect to the measured JES.  This shifting of the jet $p_T$ changes the $p_T$ spectrum of the jet which effects the dijet invariant mass, and ultimately the reconstructed Higgs boson mass.  Table ~\ref{tab:JES} shows the uncertainty for a range of generated Higgs mass samples. The effect of jet resolution uncertainty on the signal was done by smearing a sub-sample of jets in a sample and looking at the difference between smeared and non smeared events but the effect was negligible.  The background is evaluated from data so there should not be a significant effect on those events.

\subsection{b-Tagging}
Scale factors between data and simulation have been measured for events with b-jets in bins as a function of $p_T$ and $\eta$.  This solves the problem that b-jets are more correctly identified in Monte Carlo simulation than they are in data.  Also a mis-tag rate scale factor is calculated when light jets are tagged as heavy jets.  For the systematic effects both the scale factor for tagging ($SF_b$) and scale factor for mis-tags ($SF_{mis-tag}$) are varied up and down by the uncertainty related to each SF. In the analysis the exact systematic uncertainty (computed as a function of the Higgs mass) is applied.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{MET uncertainty}

When looking at MET uncertainty the bulk of the effect comes from our knowledge of the rest of the event, primarily jet energy reconstruction and pileup.  As both of these uncertainties are treated already, much of the MET uncertainty is already taken into account.  In signal and Z+jets background there is no real MET, but it is expected to be seen in $\Pqt \Paqt$ events.  The uncertainty is found by subtraction the $\Pqt \Paqt$ from simulation from both data and simulation, and then looking at the differences between data and simulation. In addition we look at how much of the MET re-scaling affects the signal selection efficiency.  This is done by counting the number of signal events that cross the final MET cut that we use.  This equates to about $\sim 0.5$\% uncertainty on the final efficiency.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Pileup}
\label{sec:pileupSystematics}
The number of true interactions per bunch crossing in the simulated samples was re-weighed to match the distributions in data. The uncertainty on the measurement of the amount of pileups in data is applied to this analysis. This can modify the signal efficiency primarily two ways.  First the are additional particles in the jets which will change the reconstructed quadrimomentum.  Second, this will introduce a bias in the lepton isolation variables and lower the efficiency in the lepton requirements. 
  This uncertainty is studied by re-estimating the number of true interactions in data with different values of minimum-bias cross section as input, using 65.84~mb and 72.77~mb as recommended by the CMS pileup group~\cite{pileupsys}, which is $\pm 5\%$ difference with respect to the central value 69.30~mb. The re-estimated distributions and the central value are compared in Figure~\ref{fig:shiftedDataPileup}. The number of true interactions are weighted in the MC to match the shifted distributions in data in Figure~\ref{fig:shiftedDataPileup} and re-compute the signal efficiency. This leads to a change in the signal efficiency $< 1\%$ for the 0- and 1-btag categories, and about 2\% for the 2-btag category, for $\MH < 650 GeV$, approximately independent of lepton channel.  These numbers and additional details can be seen in Appendix~\ref{sec:appsyst}.

\subsection{Production mechanism}

The expected kinematics of the Higgs production is subject to uncertainties due to limited knowledge of  the underlying parton distribution functions (PDFs) as well as the shortcomings in the theoretical prediction (missing higher orders in the perturbation series). These uncertainties are propagated to an uncertainty on the selection acceptance and efficiency. Their additional effect on the Higgs production cross section is discussed in a separate section below.

The PDF uncertainties is evaluated according to the PDF4LHC recommendations, by evaluating the selection efficiency for the PDF sets: cteq66~\cite{cteq66}, MSTW2008NLO~\cite{MSTW} and  NNPDF2.1~\cite{NNPDF} and their error sets. The envelope of the various PDF sets is used as the total uncertainty, as recommended and amounts to 1-4\%. The uncertainty noticeably increases for very high Higgs masses. A summary of systematic uncertainties on the signal acceptance following PDF4LHC recommendations can be found in table~\ref{tab:pdf}.

\def\arraystretch{1.7}
\begin{table*}[hb]

\def\arraystretch{1}

Additional uncertainties arise due to uncertainties on the Higgs signal shape
that is theoretically calculated. The shape uncertainty is evaluated 
in the recommended way for the Higgs decaying into a pair of Z boson,
correctly accounting for the correct lineshape (i.e. re-weighting of the
given shape in POWHEG) which also accounts for interference effects.
The full description of the re-weighting and uncertainty 
method is given in~\cite{4l} and provides an
uncertainty that contributes
in two ways: Due to the mass-dependence of the selection efficiency, the total signal efficiency is affected by the line shape. 
%Efficiency curves for the nominal and alternative line shapes are shown in figure~\ref{fig:shapeff}.
 The uncertainty is negligible below 400 GeV{} and rises to $\sim3\%$ at 600 GeV{}, with only small dependence on btag category.

Additionally the line-shape used in the CLs procedure is re-extracted with the alternative line-shape models (Figure~\ref{fig:lineshape}~(left)). The tail caused by mismatched jets is not affected at all as it is a random mixture of events, averaging out any shifts from the uncertainty. The core of the signal distribution is only weakly affected by the uncertainty. In the worst case (the highest mass we consider), the peak-position shifts by $\sim2 GeV$ (compared to a sigma of 60 GeV{}) and the sigma changes by $\sim1 GeV$. Due the minuscule effect of this uncertainty, it is not propagated further.

\subsection{Luminosity uncertainty}

The latest recommendation for the 2012 data sets is the uncertainty on LHC luminosity of 4.4$\%$~\cite{CMS-PAS-LUM-12-001}.

\subsection*{Higgs cross-section and branching fractions}

The Higgs production cross-section uncertainty depends on production mechanism, either gluon fusion or weak boson fusion (WBF). However, since the gluon fusion mechanism
dominates, it drives the total uncertainty.  We use $gg$ and WBF errors separately and for each mass point according to Yellow Report prescription~\cite{LHCHiggsCrossSectionWorkingGroup:2012ti}. The total weighted error is in the range 13--15\%. This uncertainty does not affect the absolute cross-section measurement.

\subsection{Background normalization uncertainties}

Lepton trigger and reconstruction uncertainties yield a 2\% variation in the
normalization of the $\mlljj$ spectrum. Uncertainties on the muon momentum scale,
electron energy scale, pile-up reweighting and the MET re-scaling procedure have a negligible impact. Jet energy scale uncertainty 
causes an uncertainty on the normalization of 5.5\%.
The uncertainty on the scale factors for the b-tagging efficiency has an affect on the normalization
of 0.4\%, 0.8\% and 4.5\% for the the 0-, 1- and 2-btag categories respectively. The uncertainty on the 
b-tagging mistag rates introduces an uncertainty in the normalization of 1.9\%, 7.8\% and 6.2\% 
for the the 0-, 1- and 2-btag categories respectively.






\subsection{Background shape uncertainties}

The impact on the $\mlljj$ distributions of the uncertainties affecting the shape is displayed in 
Figures~\ref{fig:sysshape} and~\ref{fig:sysshape2d}. Jet energy scale causes a 
$\mlljj$-dependent uncertainty varying from almost 0
at low mass, up to 4\% at 600 GeV.

To estimate the impact of the $\pt^{\ell\ell jj}$ correction we compare the $\mlljj$ Z+jets background distributions with and without the correction.
A mass-dependent systematic uncertainty is obtained as the difference of those distributions,
and goes up to 3\% at high $\mlljj$ values.

Residual differences in the $\mlljj$ distributions between the data and the background, in the
$M_{jj}$ sideband control region are taken as an additional mass-dependent systematic uncertainty. 
Those residual differences are plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:sysshaperes}~(top). In order to smooth out
the fluctuations, a linear variation as shown in the figure is used to incorporate this effect into
alternative templates for the background prediction. The resulting alternative templates, around 
the nominal template, are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:sysshaperes}~middle and bottom, for the electron and muon channels respectively.

\subsection{Upper and Lower Side Band Comparison}

In order to estimate how MC reproduced the shape in data for the sideband we plot both data-MC and the ratio $\dfrac{data}{MC}$.  In particular we also compare
the shapes in the lower and upper sidebands to get a more accurate picture of the shape.  This give a more accurate representation of the error in the
background that looking at the shape difference between $m_{jjll} p_{T}$-reweighted and $m_{jjll}$ non $p_{T}$-weighted. The exclusive $\PZ$+Jets samples (1-4 jets)
are $m_{jjll} p_{T}$-weighted.  The data and MC are normalized to unity before comparisons. The plots for are three categories are
shown in Figures ~\ref{fig:0tag_sideband_up_down}, ~\ref{fig:1tag_sideband_up_down}, and ~\ref{fig:2tag_sideband_up_down}.
